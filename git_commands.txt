git init //establishes the folder you want to do Github stuff in. Use sommands like dir to choose a location and then cd (whatever file) to get to that location
git add (whatever but must add the .txt or .doc or .exe or .whatever)
git add . //adds everything that was modified

git status //looks what's inside the commit (what might happen is that you will see GREEN text and RED text. The Green text is what your contribution to the code, however the
Red text signifies that someone else had already made a modification). This might also be caused by you making an edit but not saving it into your commit. To do this do
the "git add (whatever file this may be)"

git commit -m "My commit message" //established the commit.... now you need to send it...
git push origin master //sends the commit, username and pass will come up

IF you get an error from this use the following line: git pull origin development



How to add repositor:

git remote add origin https://github.com/Guildedwings/Verona.git

if nothing is coming up within the commit

touch "filename".txt (or whatever the . is)









dir - You can see whatever is in the file
